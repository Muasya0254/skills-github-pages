Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting text. While Markdown itself doesn't have a built-in commenting syntax like some other programming languages, you can still include comments in your Markdown files for documentation purposes or to provide additional context for readers.

In Markdown, you can use HTML comments to add comments to your Markdown documents. HTML comments are not rendered in the final output, so they're perfect for adding notes or explanations for yourself or other collaborators.

Here's how you can add comments using HTML comment syntax:

```
<!-- This is a comment. It won't be rendered in the final output. -->
```

You can also use Markdown syntax to format your comments for better readability:

```
<!-- 
    This is a multi-line comment.
    You can use multiple lines to provide detailed explanations or notes.
-->
```

Comments can be useful for:

- Providing context or explanations for complex Markdown syntax.
- Documenting your Markdown files for future reference.
- Communicating with collaborators about specific sections of a document.

However, keep in mind that comments are not visible in the rendered output, so make sure to use them judiciously and provide sufficient context within the main content of your Markdown document.
